# UDM-Bell-ADMZ

**Self-hosted Python application to fix ADMZ issues between routers and Bell GigaHub modems.**

## Introduction

`UDM-Bell-ADMZ` addresses a long-standing Advanced-DMZ (ADMZ) issue experienced when connecting any router to a Bell GigaHub modem via the 10Gbps LAN port. When the modem reboots, it sometimes hands out an internal IP address instead of a public WAN address, causing double NAT issues.

*Note:* This has been tested with GigaHub/HomeHub 4000 modems and UDM-SE routers. It may work with similar models, but results may vary.

### Common Workarounds

1. **Hope the modem doesn't reboot:** Use a UPS and hope for stability â€” unreliable.
2. **Use PPPoE Passthrough:** Requires a router with sufficient CPU to handle PPPoE overhead, which may not be viable with high-speed fiber connections.
3. **Accept double NAT:** Live with an internal IP and double NAT.

### How UDM-Bell-ADMZ Fixes the Issue

When the router detects it has received an internal IP address, the following steps are performed automatically:

- **[Router]** Generate a random MAC address for the WAN interface.
- **[Router]** Set WAN interface to a static IP.
- **[Modem]** Set the new MAC address for ADMZ.
- **[Modem]** Enable ADMZ and DHCP.
- **[Modem]** Flush DHCP leases.
- **[Modem]** Reboot.
- **Wait** for the reboot to complete.
- **[Router]** Revert WAN interface to DHCP.

After these steps, your router will correctly obtain a public IP address.
